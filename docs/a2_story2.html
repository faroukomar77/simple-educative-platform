      <h2 class="title">The Camping Trip</h2>
      <p>
        Jack and his friends planned a camping trip in the mountains. They
        packed tents, sleeping bags, food, and water. After a two-hour drive,
        they reached the campsite. The view was amazingâ€”trees, birds, and a
        beautiful river.

        They set up their tents and collected wood for a fire. In the evening,
        they sat around the fire, told stories, and roasted marshmallows.
        Suddenly, it started to rain. They ran into their tents, laughing and
        wet. Despite the rain, they enjoyed the adventure. The trip made them
        closer and gave them memories they will never forget.
