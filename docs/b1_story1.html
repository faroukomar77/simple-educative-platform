      <h2 class="title">The Missed Flight</h2>
      <p>
        Emma had been planning her trip to Rome for months. She packed her bags
        carefully, double-checked her passport, and set an early alarm. However,
        on the morning of her flight, she overslept because she forgot to turn
        on her alarm
      </p>
      <p>
        She rushed to the airport, hoping she could still make it.
        Unfortunately, by the time she arrived, the boarding gate was already
        closed. Feeling frustrated, she went to the airline desk. They offered
        her a seat on the next flight in the evening. Although it wasnâ€™t how she
        planned her day, Emma decided to explore the airport, read a book, and
        enjoy a coffee.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the time she reached Rome that night, she had learned a valuable
        lesson about always setting more than one alarm.
