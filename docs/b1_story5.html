      <h2 class="title">The Cooking Mistake</h2>
      <p>
        Nina wanted to surprise her family with a homemade dinner. She found a
        recipe for lasagna online and bought all the ingredients. She followed
        the steps carefully, but she accidentally set the oven to the wrong
        temperature.
      </p>

      <p>
        fter 40 minutes, the lasagna was still cold in the middle and slightly
        burnt on the top. Feeling disappointed, she told her family what
        happened. They all laughed and helped her fix it by heating it properly.
        Despite the mistake, everyone enjoyed the meal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nina realized that cooking is about learning, and even small mistakes
        can bring people together with laughter.
