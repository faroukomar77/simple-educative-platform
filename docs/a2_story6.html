      <h2 class="title">The Bicycle Problem</h2>
      <p>
        David rides his bicycle to school every day. One morning, he heard a
        strange sound while riding. He stopped and saw his back tire was flat.
        He didn’t know what to do—he didn’t have a repair kit. He started
        walking his bike slowly, hoping to find help.
      </p>
      <p>
        A kind old man from a nearby shop saw him and offered to fix the tire.
        David waited patiently and talked with the man. After 15 minutes, the
        bike was ready again. David thanked him and continued to school. That
        day, he decided to carry a small tool kit, just in case.
