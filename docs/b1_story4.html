      <p>
        Carlos wanted to improve his English speaking skills, so he joined an
        online language exchange program. He was paired with Lily, a girl from
        Canada who wanted to learn Spanish. At first, their conversations were a
        bit awkward because they were both shy. But week by week, they became
        more comfortable.
      </p>

      <p>
        They discussed music, movies, and their daily lives. Carlos noticed his
        confidence growing, and Lily said her Spanish was improving too. After a
        few months, they became good friends and even planned to meet one day
        during a holiday. It was more than just language practiceâ€”it became a
        cultural exchange and a friendship.
