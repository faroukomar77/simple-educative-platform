      <p>
        Sarah and three classmates were assigned a group project for their
        history class. At first, everything went wellâ€”they divided the work and
        met twice a week. But after a while, one member stopped showing up and
        didn't finish his part.
      </p>
      <p>
        The group grew frustrated, and their work slowed down. Sarah decided to
        talk to the missing member and found out he was dealing with family
        problems. They offered to help him catch up and adjusted the plan. In
        the end, they managed to complete the project and got a good grade.
      </p>

        The experience taught them about teamwork, empathy, and communication.
