      <p>
        Mike was in a hurry to catch the bus to work. He grabbed his bag, locked
        the door, and ran. When he got on the bus, he reached into his pocket—no
        phone! He felt nervous. What if his boss called? What if he missed an
        important message? At work, he asked to use a colleague’s phone to call
        home.

        Luckily, his sister answered and said she found the phone on the kitchen
        table. After work, Mike rushed home and thanked her. From that day, he
        always double-checked his things before leaving the house.
