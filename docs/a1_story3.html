      <p>
        Emma loves her dog Max. One sunny morning, they go to the park together.
        Max runs happily and chases butterflies. Suddenly, Max sees a squirrel
        and runs far away. Emma calls out, “Max! Come back!” but Max does not
        stop. Emma starts to worry. She looks behind trees, near benches, and
        asks people for help.
      </p>
      <p>
        After almost one hour, she hears a small bark. She finds Max sitting
        under a tree, tired but safe. Emma hugs him and gives him water. She
        learns that Max needs to stay close. From that day, she always keeps his
        leash on during walks.
