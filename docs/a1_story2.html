      <h2 class="title">Tom’s First Day at School</h2>
      <p>
        Tom is six years old, and today is a big day—it’s his first day at
        school. He wakes up early, brushes his teeth, and puts on his favorite
        blue shirt. His mother helps him pack his bag and gives him a big hug.
        At school, he meets his new teacher, Mrs. Green, who smiles warmly.
      </p>

        Tom feels shy but curious. He sits next to a girl named Sara, and they
        start talking. They draw pictures and play with blocks together. At
        lunch, Tom eats a sandwich and an apple. He enjoys talking with his new
        classmates. After school, he tells his parents, “I like school!” That
        night, he puts his backpack next to his bed, ready for tomorrow.
