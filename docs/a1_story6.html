      <h2 class="title">The Trip to the Zoo</h2>
      <p>
        Liam and his family visit the zoo on Sunday. He wears his favorite green
        hat and takes his camera. First, they see the lions lying under the sun.
        Then, they walk to the elephant area. The elephants are huge and use
        their trunks to eat. Liam laughs at the monkeys jumping and making
        faces.

        His favorite animal is the giraffe. It has a long neck and eats leaves
        from tall trees. At lunch, they eat sandwiches and drink juice near the
        zoo café. Liam asks many questions and learns a lot about animals.
        Before leaving, he buys a toy giraffe from the gift shop. He says, “I
        want to come again!”
