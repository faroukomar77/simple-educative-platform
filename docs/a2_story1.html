      <h2 class="title">Anna’s New City</h2>
      <p>
        Anna recently moved to a new city for her job. At first, everything felt
        strange—the streets, the people, and even the food. She missed her old
        friends and favorite coffee shop. One day, she decided to take a walk
        around her neighborhood. She discovered a small bookstore with a cozy
        café inside.

        The owner smiled and invited her in. She spent an hour reading and
        drinking tea. A woman next to her started a conversation, and they
        quickly became friends. Now, Anna visits the bookstore every weekend.
        The city is starting to feel like home.
