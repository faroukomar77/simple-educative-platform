      <p>
        Tom was walking through a crowded market when he realized his wallet was
        missing. He checked all his pockets but couldn’t find it. He felt panic
        rise—his ID, cards, and cash were all inside. He retraced his steps,
        looking carefully. After twenty minutes, a shop owner waved at him and
        handed him the wallet
      </p>

      <p>
        A kind stranger had found it and returned it to the shop. Nothing was
        missing. Tom was so relieved and thanked the shop owner. That day, he
        not only recovered his wallet but also regained trust in people’s
        honesty.
