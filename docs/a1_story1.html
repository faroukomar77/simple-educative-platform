      <h2 class="title">Anna’s New Cat</h2>
      <p>
        Anna is a young girl who lives in a small house with her mother and
        father. She is ten years old and loves animals. One morning, while she
        is playing in the garden, she hears a soft sound near the flowers. When
        she looks closer, she sees a small white and grey cat hiding behind a
        tree. The cat looks scared and very hungry.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anna slowly walks to the cat and gives it some milk from the kitchen.
        The cat drinks the milk and begins to feel safe. It lies down on the
        grass and falls asleep. Anna smiles and watches the cat sleep. She feels
        happy. She decides to keep the cat and calls it “Snow” because of its
        soft white fur.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, every day, Anna takes care of Snow. She feeds him, plays with him,
        and talks to him. Snow follows Anna everywhere she goes. They play in
        the garden and rest under the sun. Anna feels that Snow is her best
        friend. She is never lonely now. Snow is happy, and Anna is happy too.
