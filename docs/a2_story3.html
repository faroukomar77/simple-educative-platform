      <h2 class="title">A Busy Day at the Market</h2>
      <p>
        Lisa loves cooking, so she goes to the local market every Saturday
        morning. The market is full of colors and smellsâ€”fresh vegetables,
        fruits, bread, and flowers
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, she wants to cook a vegetable soup. She buys carrots, potatoes,
        onions, and herbs. She also finds a stall selling handmade baskets and
        buys one. While shopping, she meets an old friend from school. They
        decide to have coffee together. After returning home, Lisa cooks her
        soup while listening to music. The kitchen smells wonderful. She enjoys
        her meal and feels happy about her day
