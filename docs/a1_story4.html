      <h2 class="title">A Rainy Day</h2>
      <p>
        It’s a cold, rainy Saturday. Jake wants to play football with his
        friends, but he can’t go outside. He feels bored and sits on the couch,
        watching the raindrops on the window. His mother comes in with a book
        about space. Jake opens the book and sees pictures of planets and stars.
      </p>
      <p>
        He starts reading and learns about the moon and Mars. The more he reads,
        the more he forgets about the rain. He even draws a picture of a rocket.
        In the evening, he tells his dad, “I want to be an astronaut!” The rainy
        day becomes a fun and learning day.
