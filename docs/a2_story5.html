      <h2 class="title">The English Class Presentation</h2>
      <p>
        Maria’s English teacher told the class they had to give a short
        presentation next week. Maria felt nervous—she had never spoken in front
        of a group in English before. She chose to talk about her favorite
        movie. She wrote her script, practiced every day, and asked her brother
        to help her
      </p>
      <p>
        On the day of the presentation, her hands were shaking. But once she
        started talking, she felt more confident. Her classmates clapped, and
        the teacher said she did a great job. Maria felt proud of herself and
        less afraid to speak in English.
